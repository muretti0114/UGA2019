## Project Goal

Develop concepts, architectures, and methods that can assure the quality, 
reliablity, and security for __machine-learning-based software (MLSW)__.


## Definition of MLSW
Just for convinience, we first focus on _supervised_ machine learning only.

MLSW is a software _S_ such that:
- _S_ contains a __model__ _M_ derived by a machine-leraning process
- _S_ takes data _D = (d1, d2, ..., dn)_ as an input
- _S_ obtains a prediction _y = M(d1, d2, ..., dn)_ based on the model _M_ and the input data _D_
- _S_ performs a sequence of actions _ACT(y)= [a1(y); a2(y); ... ; an(y)]_ based on the prediction y
